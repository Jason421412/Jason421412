## Hi, I'm Jason 👋

🎓 Artificial Intelligence student with a **strong mathematical foundation** and a deep interest in **algorithms, computation, and theoretical aspects of AI**.  
I focus on understanding AI systems from **first principles**, rather than treating them as black-box tools.

---

### 🧠 Academic Focus
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence with emphasis on **algorithmic reasoning**
- 📐 Strong interest in **mathematical structures behind computation**
- 🧩 Enjoy formal problem solving and abstraction

---

### 🔬 Core Intellectual Interests
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**  
  Time complexity, space trade-offs, recursion, graph algorithms, and optimization strategies  

- **Mathematical Foundations of AI**  
  Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Discrete Mathematics, and their role in learning algorithms  

- **Machine Learning (from theory to practice)**  
  Loss functions, optimization methods, generalization, and model behavior  

---

### 🛠 Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Python, Java  
- **Concepts**:  
  - Algorithmic complexity analysis (Big-O, amortized analysis)  
  - Optimization methods (gradient-based reasoning)  
  - Problem modeling and abstraction  

---

### 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Mathematical intuition behind learning algorithms  
- Algorithm design patterns and correctness reasoning  
- Bridging theoretical understanding with practical implementation  

---

### 🎯 Philosophy
I believe strong AI systems are built on **mathematical clarity, algorithmic efficiency, and rigorous reasoning**, not just frameworks or APIs.

⚡ Fun fact: I care more about *why an algorithm works* than *how fast I can code it*.
